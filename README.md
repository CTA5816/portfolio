# portfolio
Portfolio of code I've written for various projects. 

## full_pipeline.py
This file converts raw R2C2 read data from a Nanopore sequencer into processed .csv files. I wrote this for the Molecular Information Systems Lab at the University of Washington for their DNA data storage + Cas12a RAM project. No other contributors wrote code for this project.

Note: This script was highly project-specific and depends on files which are not publicly available, so a user will not be able to run this on their own.

## expression.py and plyParser.py
I wrote these in sophomore year of high school as part of a larger project ([Clean-Math](https://github.com/minw1/Clean-Math)), in which two of my friends and I tried to make a useful digital math notebook with sophisticated expression parsing. These files describe a parser which can convert strings representing arbitrary mathematical expressions into hierarchical data structures. These scripts are mostly my work, though my partners made non-trivial contributions.

Note: These may depend on other files contained in the project folder and are not designed to be run independently.

## correct_colors.py
This modifies the colors in a given image file such that the file is compatible with a climate-calculation program for fantasy worldbuilding. No other contributors added to this file. More information can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/PHarvey7/speculative-koppen).
